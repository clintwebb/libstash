Items to do:


----
In stash_init(), remove the RISP commands that are commented out, and not required for network communications
----
when connecting to the server.  If the server does not accept, client will wait forever.
----
manpage: stash_cond_t
manpage: stash_return_reply
manpage: stash_reply_t
manpage: stash_value_t
----
library interface: locksets
----
the connections need to take the priority into account when establishing connections.  First iteration allows for it to just 
attempt the first, and if that drops off, try the next... and so on.
----
Add some comments to conn_free()
----
In stash.h, add a banner stating that instructions for using each function and structure can be found in the manpages.   We wont put a lot of API instructions in the .h file itself.
----
Add NDEPRICATED check around functionality which has been marked as depricated.  This will allow people to build a version that does not contain any depricated components, forcing them to use the proper stuff.
----
restructure stash.h to put functionality in sections.   This includes structure definitions where possible.
----
manpage: stash_sort
----
Sorting is done using the built in qsort, that requires some global variables to be set.  This makes the library to be non-thread-safe.  Should replace the qsort with a custom sort that works better with the kind of data that we have.
