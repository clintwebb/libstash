.SH NAME
stash_query_sort - Set sorting criteria on the query results.
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <stash.h>
.sp
.B void stash_query_sort(stash_query_t *query, stash_keyid_t kid, int desc);
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B stash_query_sort()
is used to set sortation criteria on a query.  If a row limit (see stash_query_limit) has been specified, then the sortation criteria will be sent to the server, and the data sorted before sending back only the rows specified.  If no limit was set, then the sort will be done on all the matching data that is returned, after it has been returned, but before giving control to the client.
.sp
Compound sortation can be specified by calling stash_query_sort() multiple times.  The order in which the sort is applied, is the order in which the sort settings were added.  The subsequent sort criterias will only come into play if the values of the previous criterias are the same.
